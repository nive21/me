            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              Our aim was to develop a solution to help introverts maintain a
              balance between social and personal well-being, as part of our
              class on Personal Health Informatics.

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              We developed high-fidelity functional prototypes on Figma and
              conducted user testing. The feedback we received highlighted
              discrepancies in users' mental models, and we devised solutions to
              bridge these gaps.

          <h5>Problem & Process</h5>
          <p>
            To understand the problem space, we began with a literature review
            to explore the nature of introversion. We conducted semi-structured
            interviews to capture the motivations and challenges faced by
            introverts, which helped us identify broader themes and subsequent
            implications. This process was followed by brainstorming narratives
            that addressed these implications, creating low-fidelity prototypes,
            and iterating based on user feedback before developing and testing
            high-fidelity prototypes.

          <h5>Themes and Design Implications</h5>
          Through affinity diagramming with insights from the interviews, we
          identified three broad themes: a preference for quality time to get to
          know others, a need to push oneself to engage socially to improve, and
          a motivation to enhance social skills and expand social circles. From
          these insights, we identified six opportunities:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Find People with Similar Interests: Recommend events that align
              with users’ interests and allow users to filter events based on
              their comfort level.
            </li>
            <li>
              Help Connect in Smaller Groups: Give users the option to connect
              with a few other attendees via the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Qualitative Reflection: Use similarity in preferences for grouping
              and making recommendations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quantitative Feedback on People and Events: Provide measurable
              feedback on the growth of connections and the impact of events
              attended.
            </li>
            <li>
              Balance Personal and Social Well-being: Show insights on how
              socialization affects their well-being, such as the frequency of
              events and its impact on wellness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gamification to Motivate Initial Engagement: Use rewards, goals,
              and leaderboards to motivate users at varying engagement levels.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="full-width-image">

            Although people appreciated the app's socialization and reflection
            features, some found certain charts and data collection confusing.

          <h5>Outcome</h5>
          Using these six design implications, we iterated and tested our
          prototypes. The final high-fidelity prototype testing revealed that
          participants appreciated:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Easy Connections: The ability to chat and connect with others
              through the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grouping Before the Event: Positive responses to being grouped
              with strangers beforehand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Tracking: The capability to monitor their events,
              connections, and changes over time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <h5>Challenges</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understanding of Graphs: Participants struggled with interpreting
              the graphs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transparency of Data Collection: Confusion about the necessity and
              use of their data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leaderboard System: A unified leaderboard was found to be
              demotivating for newer users.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <h5>Next steps</h5>
          Based on the results, the design implications include enhanced context
          for graphs and data entries, and leaderboards tailored to different
          stages of user engagement.
