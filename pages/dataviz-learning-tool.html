            <h5>Context</h5>
            <p>
              In this project, we aimed to introduce a tool for exploring
              multivariate data, capitalizing on the increased availability and
              affordability of touch-based systems. Our objective was to teach
              data visualization and exploration concepts to young learners
              using various multitouch interaction techniques as shortcuts to
              expedite tasks.

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              We designed and implemented a multitouch interactive
              data-visualization tool targeted at middle-school students to
              facilitate data exploration practice. The tool was primarily
              developed using JavaScript (including D3.js), HTML, and CSS. It
              enables users to interact via pointers, allowing for the use of
              fingers (touch) or a stylus interchangeably. Most functions are
              also accessible through alternative mouse clicks or mouse wheel
              interactions.

            <p>
              This was a project of two in Georgia Tech. While we worked
              together throughout the project, I focused more on the design
              aspects - literature review, brainstorming ideas, prototyping, and
              reporting, while my teammate focused on the development end.

          <h5>Problem Identification</h5>
          <p>
            Our literature review revealed that guided interactive
            learning—where learners actively engage with information to build
            their own mental representations—is associated with improved
            comprehension. Furthermore, visualizations with interactive
            capabilities were found to enhance comprehensibility significantly.
            Based on these findings, we developed a guided data exploration tool
            that leverages active interaction techniques for analysis.

          <h5>Features</h5>
          After researching similar tools such as TinkerPlots, Kinetica, and
          DataBreeze, we outlined our requirements, including:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Unit Visualizations: The tool utilizes unit visualizations as the
              charting type due to their intuitive nature, direct mapping to
              each data point, and flexibility to transform into various
              visualization types like dot plots, scatter plots, and beeswarms.
              This approach also supports accessing details on demand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Zoom and Pan: We addressed the limitation of the 'pinch to zoom'
              option with fixed aspect ratios in scatter plots by enabling
              pinching both on the chart and along an axis. Users can also
              perform a lasso selection when zoomed in. For panning, we
              implemented a single-pointer drag along the axis to avoid
              interfering with lasso selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sorting and Updating: Users can change the order of attributes
              along an axis by long-pressing on the axis label, avoiding
              interference with axis zoom/pan. Updating the x-axis attribute can
              be performed via a four-pointer swipe on the chart area, also
              achievable from the control panel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Undo/Redo: Actions can be reversed with a three-finger swipe to
              the right, or redone with a swipe to the left on the chart.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Challenges</h5>
          We encountered several challenges:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Browsers such as Firefox and Chrome recognized multiple
              pointer-downs but tracked pointer-moves for only one pointer at a
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conflicts between touch and mouse interactions led to issues, such
              as tooltips activating incorrectly. We temporarily disabled
              actions on mouseover to mitigate this, although it remains a
              limitation for mouse users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some multitouch interactions conflicted with system and browser
              default shortcuts, like long presses opening context menus. We
              disabled these default gestures, but this solution may not be
              ideal for users accustomed to these shortcuts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="key-text-section">
        <div>
          <h4>
            The next phase involves evaluating the tool with middle-school
            students to measure its effectiveness in teaching relevant concepts.
            A long-term study would also be beneficial to assess how easily
            students adapt to the multitouch shortcuts.
