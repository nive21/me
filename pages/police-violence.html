            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              The challenge was to create a scrollytelling website that
              presented data on police violence in the US for my graduate class,
              'Principles of Data Visualization'.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              Utilizing tools like Tableau, AfterEffects, and HTML/CSS, we
              developed a website that narrated a story through insights
              revealed and charts animated upon scrolling. The site also
              featured an interactive data exploration tool, enabling users to
              delve into the data and discover their own insights.

          <p>
            Our initial major task was to select the most suitable
            datasetâ€”optimal in size and rich in significant, engaging stories.
            After cleaning the dataset, we imported it into Tableau for
            exploratory analysis to pinpoint key insights. Concurrently, a
            literature review helped clarify these insights and identify
            narratives that integrated with our story.

          <h5>Story Development</h5>
          Our exploration of the data and subsequent literature review yielded
          three key focal points:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Magnitude: We compared the total number of cases in the US to
              those in other countries, uncovering scholarly articles that
              speculated on possible reasons for these disparities. We also
              investigated correlations between the number of incidents, time,
              geography, and the political climate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use of Weapon: Our analysis identified firearms as the predominant
              weapon used both by police officers and alleged victims. Our
              visualizations aimed to illustrate the impact of firearm
              possession on police violence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Racial Bias: We discovered that victims not carrying weapons were
              predominantly from specific racial backgrounds. This finding was
              supported by numerous research studies, and we incorporated
              additional news articles about individual cases and their broader
              implications.
            </li>
          </ul>
          We storyboarded various narration approaches before deciding on a
          sequence that began with an individual victim's story, expanded to
          include international comparisons, and concluded with a comprehensive
          data visualization for user interaction.

      <div class="sbs">
        <h4>
          For each visualization, we considered multiple designs, assessing
          their strengths and weaknesses before finalizing our choice for
          development in Tableau.

            Post-Tableau, I converted the visuals into .AI files, then animated
            them in AfterEffects, and finally imported them as Lottie files that
            activated on scroll. At the story's end, we integrated a Tableau
            visualization for further data exploration.
