            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              For our capstone project in the graduate Human-Computer
              Interaction class, our objective was to explore the problem and
              solution space around the theme ‘Remembering the Departed’. We
              gathered survey data and iterated on prototypes, evaluated them
              against a set of usability criteria, selected the most promising
              prototype, and conducted a Wizard-of-Oz test.

            <h5>Results</h5>
            Our exploration led us to the potential of using audio stories to
            memorialize the departed. The Wizard-of-Oz prototype testing
            resulted in several design implications:
            <ul>
              <li>Implementing a narrative format to boost engagement</li>
              <li>Incorporating ambient sounds to enhance immersivity</li>
              <li>Providing alternative modalities to facilitate learning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We were a team of three at Georgia Tech, collaborating on this
              project. We contributed equally in all stages of the project by
              alternating continuously between working together and separately.
              For example, we would brainstorm ideas individually and discuss
              the shortlist the best few.

          <p>
            Survey respondents expressed a strong interest in learning about the
            personal life achievements, stories, and experiences of historical
            figures. This feedback uncovered an opportunity to help people
            connect personally with admired historical figures.

          <h5>Exploring the Solution Space</h5>
          <p>
            Adopting our Point of View (POV) statement, we developed three
            personas to guide our ideation process. Each team member generated
            eight quick ideas using the Crazy 8s technique, resulting in a total
            of 32 concepts. We narrowed these down to three for which we created
            detailed storyboards. Utilizing scenarios, task analyses, and UI
            critiques of similar products, we refined our ideas and reached a
            team consensus.
            <br /><br />We set specific goals to evaluate our prototypes,
            focusing on accessibility and memorability. Each prototype was
            scored against these goals by all team members. Additionally, we
            collected feedback during a poster session where we presented our
            storyboard options to attendees. Based on these evaluations, we
            concluded that an audio app embodying the persona of a historical
            figure and facilitating ubiquitous learning most effectively met our
            goals.

          <h5>Outcome</h5>
          <p>
            Employing an AI audio generation tool that mimicked the voice of
            John F. Kennedy, we devised and tested three tasks through a
            Wizard-of-Oz prototype. Following initial tests and participant
            feedback, we conducted further evaluations with nine participants.
            <br /><br />
            These tests confirmed the importance of offering multiple modalities
            in learning. For instance, participants noted the absence of an
            option to skim through information and felt difficulty in
            remembering the information presented by the app. Feedback also
            indicated that purely factual responses were less engaging. From
            this, we deduced the necessity of using a narrative approach and
            incorporating ambient sounds that transport users to the historical
            setting, thereby enhancing engagement and immersion.

          <h5>Reflection</h5>
          <p>
            In our usability study, we assumed all participants were familiar
            with smart speakers, which led to gaps in our explanation of the
            interface and features. We could have tailored these details based
            on pre-questionnaire responses or shared them with all
            participants.<br /><br />
            Additionally, our survey lacked open-ended questions about
            participants' reasons for using or not using smart speakers. This
            oversight limited our understanding of user interactions and
            preferences. In one of the interviews, further probing revealed
            challenges in our design decision to use an audio interface,
            indicating a need for broader questioning.
