            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              The Tableau 2021 Student Iron Viz competition challenged
              participants to tell a story using music data. The entries were
              evaluated based on creativity, analysis, beauty/design, and
              adherence to best practices.

          <br />

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              My data visualization secured third place among global entries.
              Utilizing Spotify metrics, Billboard songs, lyric keywords, and
              the NRCLex library, I crafted a dashboard that illustrated the
              shifting sentiments of people over time through their preferences
              in music.

          <h5>Problem Identification</h5>
          <p>
            The primary challenge was finding the right datasets to effectively
            convey a story. I began with Spotify data, which included metrics on
            the positivity of songs. This inspired me to explore how these
            attributes could reflect public sentiment over time. Using Spotify,
            I analyzed the positivity, speechiness, loudness, and energy of
            popular songs annually. I expanded my research to categorize the
            emotion of song lyrics each decade with the help of NRCLex library.

          <h5>Story development</h5>
          <p>
            In my visualizations, I opted for radial designs that echoed the
            appearance of vinyl records. These visuals revealed a trend of
            decreasing positivity in music, while speechiness, loudness, and
            energy levels have increased over the years.<br /><br />Further
            analysis showed a concurrent decrease in negative keywords and a
            marked rise in expressions of anger, disgust, fear, and darkness
            during the 2000s.<br /><br />Lastly, an exploratory feature of the
            dashboard enabled an in-depth review of the positivity trends in
            songs over the years, uncovering interesting patterns such as a
            surge in positive songs around Christmas.
