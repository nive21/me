            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              As part of Dr. Amy Bruckman's team, I delved into the discourse
              surrounding guns on Reddit. Our goal was to understand the
              motivations and impact of these online conversations, and identify
              ways to promote to constructive intergroup interactions.
            </p>

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              We conducted interviews with 20 active participants of gun-related
              Reddit discussions, combining qualitative analysis of the
              interviews with quantitative examination of gun-related posts.
              <br /><br />
              Our research paper was submitted to the Computer-Supported
              Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW) 2024 conference and is
              currently undergoing review.

            <p>
              The project was led by Rijul, a PhD student at Georgia Tech and
              was overviewed by Prof. Amy Bruckman. As the second author, I
              conducted half of the 20 semi-structured interviews, transcibed
              all, and conducted and documented the literature review.

          <h5>Process</h5>
          <p>
            Utilizing digital ethnography methods, I identified subreddits with
            diverse perspectives on gun politics. I observed discussions, noted
            active users, and reached out to them for interviews. The
            semi-structured interviews, following the IRB protocol, lasted
            between 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. I aimed to explore participants'
            social media usage, engagement with the subreddit, recent posts,
            motivations for involvement in gun politics, and the disparity
            between their online and offline discussions.

          <h5>Observations</h5>
          <p>
            Participants' initial political leanings often correlated with their
            geographical region and familial influences. However, some
            experienced shifts in their perspectives due to personal experiences
            or influential figures they followed. Despite some expressing
            openness to changing their views through online interactions, our
            interviews did not reveal any such instances. Our observations of
            Reddit interactions also indicated limited cross-ideology exchanges.

        <div>
          <h5>Insights</h5>
          <p>
            Subreddits dedicated to gun politics typically exhibited strong
            alignment with specific stances, often leading to the removal or
            brigading of opposing viewpoints, and hence limited intergroup
            discussions. From the qualitative data collected, we identified
            personal stories as effective tools for prompting consideration of
            alternative perspectives. However, the settings must foster a shared
            identity rather than partisan affiliations (Research suggests that
            emphasizing common identity, such as national identity, can mitigate
            partisan biases and facilitate intergroup understanding).
