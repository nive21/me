            <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>
              As part of a school project for the Qualitative Research Methods
              course, I conducted a participatory design study with three
              classmates acting as the participants. My aim was to explore how
              we could design food experiences tailored to students on campus. I
              had 30 minutes to complete the session.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div>
            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
              Based on insights gained from the five tasks centered around food,
              I formulated three "how-might-we" insights.

          <h5>Process</h5>
          <p>I devised the following five short tasks:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Creating a mood board illustrating their ideal summer day.</li>
            <li>Deciding a food order within a set budget.</li>

              Crafting a scenario and making a decision given the scenario.
            </li>
            <li>Prioritizing decision-making factors.</li>
            <li>
              Describing best, worst, and everyday food experiences through
              sketches.

          <h5>Insights</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants exhibited diverse social preferences regarding
              dining, ranging from solitary to intimate or communal gatherings.
            </li>
            <li>
              All three participants expressed a fondness for their respective
              home cuisines, whether it be pancakes, Indian dishes, or Asian
              food.
            </li>
            <li>
              The decision to dine out was influenced by various factors such as
              food quality, price, and proximity to school or suitability to
              work at the dining place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cost emerged as a primary concern for all participants, with one
              student emphasizing the importance of separating dining areas from
              workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Experiences were perceived less favorably when expectations were
              high, highlighting the impact of prior dining experiences.
            </li>

          <h5>Design implications</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How might we maintain a clear distinction between work and dining
              spaces while keeping them conveniently close? One solution could
              involve utilizing different table designsâ€”organic shapes for
              dining areas and geometric layouts for workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we offer access to comfort foods? Given the diverse
              cultural backgrounds of students and their attachment to native
              cuisines, occasional offerings of different cuisines could provide
              a sense of home comfort. For instance, students could opt into
              dining on days when specific cuisines are featured.
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we accommodate varied socialization preferences and
              scenarios? By designing flexible physical settings and offering a
              range of food options, we can cater to students' preferences for
              privacy or sociability. This could involve providing portable
              meals for students on the go, as well as full-course dining
              options to encourage communal gatherings.
